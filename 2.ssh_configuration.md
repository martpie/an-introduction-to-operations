# 2. SSH and OS configuration

SSH is nothing else than a software, it has options and configuration files.

The default options are simple, but may not be the most secure options, let's see what we can improve.

## 2.1 OS configuration

As you saw, when we connect to the server, the default user is `root`.

It has multiple problems:

- `root` is a super-user user with access to all the files
- we **never** want to use it as it is easy to mess things up
- if someone malicious has a access to the user, he could do litteraly anything to the server

### 2.1.1 Creating a new user

The first step towards adding more layers of security is to create a custom user.

```bash
adduser <new-user>
```

### 2.1.2 Adding a user to the `sudo` group

Your new user is created, but we sometimes still need to run commands with `sudo`. For that, we need to add this new user to the `sudo` group.

```bash
usermod -aG sudo <new-user>
```

### 2.1.3 Testing that everything works properly

Let's connect to the newly created user:

```bash
su - <new-user>
```

Test that you are part of `sudo`:

```bash
sudo whoami
```

Alternatively, you could log out (`ctrl-D`), and use:

```bash
ssh <new-user>@<host>
```

### 2.1.4 Add an SSH key for this user

Don't forget to add your SSH key to this user (cf [SSH Connection](1.ssh_connection.md)).

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i <path-of-the-ssh-key> <new-user>@<host>
```

## 2.2 SSH configuration [TODO]

- Disable root login
- Disable password authentication

#PubkeyAuthentication yes
#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
#PermitRootLogin no

#PasswordAuthentication no
#PermitEmptyPasswords no
#StrictModes yes

## 2.3 Bonus: SSH with a UI [TODO]

- Filezilla
