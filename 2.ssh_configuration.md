# 2. SSH and OS configuration

SSH is nothing else than a software, it has options and configuration files.

The default options are simple, but may not be the most secure options, let's see what we can improve.

## 2.1 OS configuration

As you saw, when we connect to the server, the default user is `root`.

It has multiple problems:

- `root` is a super-user user with access to all the files
- we **never** want to use it as it is easy to mess things up
- if someone malicious has a access to the user, he could do litteraly anything to the server

### 2.1.1 Creating a new user

The first step towards adding more layers of security is to create a custom user.

```bash
adduser <new-user>
```

### 2.1.2 Adding a user to the `sudo` group

Your new user is created, but we sometimes still need to run commands with `sudo`. For that, we need to add this new user to the `sudo` group.

```bash
usermod -aG sudo <new-user>
```

### 2.1.3 Testing that everything works properly

Let's connect to the newly created user:

```bash
su - <new-user>
```

Test that you are part of `sudo`:

```bash
sudo whoami
# or sudo apt update
```

Alternatively, you could log out (`ctrl-D`), and use:

```bash
ssh <new-user>@<host>
```

### 2.1.4 Add an SSH key for this user

Don't forget to add your SSH key to this user (cf [SSH Connection](1.ssh_connection.md)).

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i <path-of-the-ssh-key> <new-user>@<host>
```

## 2.2 SSH configuration

## 2.2.1 Disable root login

Remember we used to connect via SSH to the server with the `root` user? Let's imagine someone manages to get the password for this user, this someone could do anything to your server: install new packages, remove or steal files, etc.

We want to confine users to the minimum amount of rights possible for better security in case of something going wrong.

SSH gives us options to secure our servers and prevent this kind of nasty things to happen. To open the configuration file of SSH, you can use the following command

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

> ℹ️ information
>
> - `sudo` is a command to execute a program with super-user rights. It is required to edit, execute, and sometimes just access some files in some directories of your server.
> - `nano` is a minimalistic text editor

- in the file, set `PermitRootLogin` to `no`, save and exit (`ctrl+x`).
- restart the ssh daemon: `systemctl restart ssh`
If you log out (`ctrl+d`), you should not able to `ssh root@<host>` anymore.

> ⚠️ warning
>
> - it can be extremely easy to lock yourself out of your server with SSH configuration, be careful (e.g, if you disable root login without setting up another user)

## 2.2.2 Disable password authentication

As saw earlier, password authentication, is rather a bad idea for critical services. We should also disable logins with passwords.

In the same file, you can set `PasswordAuthentication` to `no`.

## 2.2.3 Other useful settings

```
# Allow SSH key connection (default is yes)
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# disable password for "root", but allow SSH keys (not adviced)
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password

# Disable login for users with empty passwords
PermitEmptyPasswords no

# Force permissions checks on keyfiles and directories
StrictModes yes
```

## 2.3 [bonus] SSH with a UI

Sometimes, it can be convenient for beginners to use a GUI rather than a terminal to access files on a server.

You can use [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) to connect to any server supporting SSH to navigate server files and directories.

We now have a secure way to connect to a server, but a couple of things may still be insecure, let's see how we can configure a firewall on a server with [Ubuntu Firewall: UFW](3.ufw_configuration.md).
