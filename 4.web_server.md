# 4. Web Server

If you go to `http://<host>` in a browser, you won't be able to see anything. The reasons is your server does not know how to respond to HTTP requests and terminate them. To handle HTTP requests, we need a Web Server.

A Web Server is a program (in case you did not understand so far, everything on a server is more or less a program) that can satisfy a Web request. It implements the HTTP protocol.

> ⚠️ warning
>
> - frequent confusion: a "protocol" is a standard, not a program

The most famous Web Server is probably `apache2` (you may have seen before files like `.htpasswd` or `.htaccess` which are configuration file for Apache).

Other famous Web Servers are:

- `nginx`: a more performant variant of Apache
- `httpd`: the oldest web server program
- `caddy`: a Web Server with an extremely easy configuration and SSL automation

In this chapter, we will install and configure `nginx`.

> ⁉️ why
>
> - `apache` is slower and older than `nginx`, and `nginx` can do many things `apache` cannot
> - `httpd` is just not used by the industry anymore
> - `caddy` is too easy (also, it is not always necessary to have SSL certificates - like when developing locally)

## 4.1 Installation

```bash
apt install nginx
```

If you open your favorite browser and input the IP of your server, you should see a `Welcome to Nginx` message.

## 4.2 Configuration

Confuguration files for `nginx` are located in `etc/nginx`. The following directories/files are especially interesting for us:

- `nginx.conf` the default configuration for all virtualhosts
- `sites-available/` list of all websites/virtualhosts on the current server
- `sites-enabled/` list of all **running**\* websites/virtualhosts on the current server

\* after `nginx` is reloaded, cf below.

### 4.2.1 Removing the default site

The site located in `sites/enabled/default` is the default one provided by `nginx`. We can safely remove it with:

```bash
rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

> ℹ️ information
>
> the `default` file is a symlink to a file located in `/etc/nginx/sites-available`. So deleting the symlink is quite safe.

To restart `nginx` with the latest changes, you can:

```bash
systemctl restart nginx
```

`http://<host>` should be unavailable after this operation.

### 4.2.2 Duplicating the default site and enabling it

Let's duplicate the default site configuration:

```bash
cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/<something>
```

And let's put it in the "enabled" folder by symlinking it:

```bash
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<something> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Restart the server, and we should be back to where we started and the website should be available again.

> ⁉️ why
>
> It can be disturbing to understand why we did not use the `default` site by default and why we needed all these manipulations. There are multiple reasons:
>
> - so you can understand how `sites-available` and `sites-enabled` work
> - `default` is a "default", not the website you want to deploy
> - if you screw up with the config of `<something>` (and it will happen), you can easily restore the default site configuration
> - I personally recommend to name your sites files based on their domain name

### 4.2.3 Site configuration's first glance

Let's have a look at the site configuration file:

```bash
cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/<something>
```

- `server {}` delimits a "virtualhost" (or server)
- `listen` tell `nginx` what ports it should listen to
- `default_server` indicates that in case of multiple virtualhosts, this one should be used when accessing the server via a domain name not listed in the config
- `root` indicates which folder to serve on your server
- `index` define files that will be used as an index (accessing `http://<host>/tada` will try to get `<root>/tada/index.html` for example
- `server_name` is useful to declare which domain name this site will be using. This is extremely useful in case you have multiple websites with different domains on the same server. `_` is a "catch all".
- `location {}` indicates a sub-block and different rules may be applied by sub-block
- `try_files` is to indicate which files `nginx` should try to serve: `try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ =404;` sill for example try to serve the file `$uri`, or the filename + `$uri.html`, or the subdirectory `$uri`, or will return a 404.

### 4.2.4 Editing the site configuration

Let's edit this file in order to adapt it to serve a static website:

```bash
nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/<something>
```

In `location {}`, let's add

```
# Media: images, icons, video, audio, HTC
location ~* \.(?:jpg|jpeg|gif|png|ico|cur|gz|svg|mp4|ogg|ogv|webm|htc)$ {
  add_header Cache-Control "max-age=2592000";
  access_log off;
}

# CSS and Javascript
location ~* \.(?:css|js)$ {
  add_header Cache-Control "max-age=31536000";
  access_log off;
}
```

This will tell the browsers to cache CSS, JS and other assets.

Also, let's enable `gzip` by adding:

```
gzip on;
gzip_vary on;
gzip_min_length 10240;
gzip_proxied expired no-cache no-store private auth;
gzip_types text/plain text/css text/xml text/javascript application/x-javascript application/xml;
gzip_disable "MSIE [1-6]\.";
```

in the `server {}` block.

There are a lot of other rules we could use (cf. the docs), but we'll keep it simple for now.

### 4.3 Writing your own website files

By default, on most servers, the website folders are located in `/var/www/html` or `/usr/share/nginx`. Let's go to this folder and create a basic html file:

```bash
nano /var/www/html/test.html
```

> ℹ️ information
>
> you can also use `touch` to create empty files

And place this little HTML page in it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

After saving your file, you should be able to access `http://<host>/test.html` and see the content of the page.

We can now create files and access them via the browser, let's enable HTTP2 and SSL certificates!
