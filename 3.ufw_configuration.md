# 2. UFW configuration

UFW stands for Uncomplicated FireWall. It is a program in charge of the fate of the internet packets coming to the server and what do to with them.

## Preamble

One famous thing for servers (and for a lot of things IT-related) is:

> Never trust what you don't control

So the philosophy to adapt when dealing with networks, could be summarized as:

- block everything by default
- allow specific traffic

## 2.1 Enable UFW

UFW is installed by default on Ubuntu, but may not be enabled. The first step is to enable UFW:

```bash
ufw enable
```

You can check the current configuration with:

```bash
ufw status verbose
```

## 2.2 Configuration

### 2.2.1 Disallow all ports

```bash
ufw default deny incoming
```

### 2.2.1 Open useful ports

```bash
ufw allow 22
ufw allow 80
```

> ℹ️ information
>
> - port 22 is the default port for SSH, not enabling it and disallowing all the other ports could lock you out of your own server (⚠️)
> - port 80 is the default port for the Web, when your browser access a URL with no specified port, it will default to 80

We have a more or less secure server, let's try to do something with it now, by installing a [web server](4.web_server.md).
