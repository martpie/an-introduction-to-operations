# 2. UFW configuration

UFW stands for Ubuntu FireWall. It is a program in charge of the fate of the internet packets coming to the server and what do to with them.

## Preamble

One famous thing for servers (and for a lot of things IT-related) is:

> Never trust what you don't control

So the philosophy to adapt when dealing with networks, could be:

- block everything by default
- allow specific traffic

## 2.1 Enable UFW

## 2.2 Enable specific ports

```
ufw allow 22
ufw allow 80
```
