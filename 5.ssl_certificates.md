# 5. SSL Certficates

When we connect to a web server, we send packets of data to it. By default, with HTTP, those packets are readable (and sometimes editable) by people between you and the server.

SSL certificates allow your browser to communicate with any server with no fear of someone being able to intercept your communications.

Technically, a certificate is a document proving the ownership of an encryption key.

> ⚠️ warning
>
> a frequent misconception with SSL certificates is they can prevent pirates from doing harm to you. SSL certificates is about **securing your communications** with a server, **it does not guarantee that the server has good intentions**

## 5.1 Certbot and nginx

Setting up SSL certificates manually is extremely complicated to get right. Hopefully, amazing guys created tools allowing us to install certificates easily on servers.

Also, SSL certificates used to be paid (and expensive), but thanks to services like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), we can get simple SSL certificates for free. Some advanced SSL certificates are still paid.

Certbot (create by the EFF) automates SSL certificates installation on most operating systems and web servers.

### 5.1.1 Installation
Let's tell our server where to look for `certbox`

```bash
apt update
apt install software-properties-common
add-apt-repository universe
add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
apt update
```

and let's install it:

```bash
apt install certbot python-certbot-nginx
```

### 5.1.2 Setup

Before everything, we should `nginx` to listen to a specific domain name:

```bash
nano /etc/sites-enabled/<something>
```

and replace `server_name: _` by `server_name: <domain.tld>`. Then restart `nginx` (and check the domain name works).

Then, let's run `certbot`:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```

> 🃏 hints
>
> - use the domain you have linked to this server's IP

### 5.1.3 Test

Go to `https://<host>`, you should see a green lock on your browser.

Let's also test that the auto-renewal works:

```bash
certbot renew --dry-run
```

> ℹ️ information
>
> Let's Encrypt certificates are only valid 90 days and need to be renewed at this interval. Thanksfully, certbot automates it for us by creating a Cron job.

We got HTTPS working, [let's deploy something real](6.deployment.md) now!
