# An introduction to Operations

A brief and practical introduction to Ops.

## Goals

The goal of this workshop is not to make you an operations expert or a super-badass sysadmin.

It is about giving you different tools and knowledge about the operations world so it becomes easier for you to talk with ops people.

It may be used by developers as a first step into the DevOps world as well.

## Prerequists

- a VPS (virtual private server) running Ubuntu\*
- a domain name (with a A record pointing to the IP of your server)
